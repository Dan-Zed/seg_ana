# Metrics Module Consolidation and Improvement

## Summary

We have completed a significant refactoring of the metrics modules in the `seg-ana` package. This work involved removing value normalization behavior, consolidating two separate metrics implementations into a single coherent module, and ensuring consistent behavior throughout the codebase. These changes will improve accuracy and reliability of measurements while simplifying the codebase.

## Background

The codebase previously contained two parallel metrics implementations:

1. **Original implementation** (`metrics.py`): The initial metrics module with basic shape analysis features.

2. **Improved implementation** (`metrics_improved.py`): An enhanced version with additional features, more sophisticated protrusion detection, and slightly different measurement approaches.

Both modules shared a common behavior: they would normalize values that were very close to 1.0 (within 0.01) exactly to 1.0. This affected roundness, ellipticity, and solidity metrics.

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Value Normalization

Removed code that automatically normalized values close to 1.0 exactly to 1.0 for:
- Roundness
- Ellipticity
- Solidity

This allows metrics to retain their precise calculated values, important for distinguishing between shapes with very similar characteristics.

### 2. Standardized on the Improved Metrics Implementation

- Initially updated all imports to use `metrics_improved` instead of `metrics`
- Renamed `metrics_improved.py` to `metrics.py` for a cleaner codebase
- Updated all imports throughout the codebase to reference the consolidated module

### 3. Fixed Tests and Supporting Scripts

- Updated tests to account for the new non-normalizing behavior
- Changed exact equality assertions (== 1.0) to threshold assertions (> 0.99)
- Updated references to metrics in all scripts
- Created a new test script (`test_metrics_comparison.py`) to replace comparison scripts

## Key Differences in Metrics Calculation

### Ellipticity

| Approach | Formula | Value Range | Perfect Circle |
|----------|---------|-------------|----------------|
| Original | major_axis / minor_axis | ≥ 1.0 | 1.0 |
| Current | minor_axis / major_axis | 0.0 - 1.0 | 1.0 |

The current approach (minor/major) is more intuitive as it produces values between 0 and 1, where 1 represents a perfect circle and values approach 0 for increasingly elongated shapes.

### Roundness

Now shows precise calculated values instead of normalizing to exactly 1.0. Perfect or near-perfect circles will show values very close to but not exactly 1.0 (typically > 0.99).

### Protrusion Detection

The current implementation uses a more sophisticated algorithm with clustering to identify distinct protrusions. This better handles complex shapes with real protrusions versus boundary noise.

## Benefits

1. **Improved Accuracy**: Non-normalized values provide greater precision for distinguishing between similar shapes.

2. **Simplified Codebase**: Single metrics implementation reduces maintenance burden and code complexity.

3. **More Intuitive Scale**: Ellipticity values in 0-1 range are more intuitive to interpret than values ≥ 1.0.

4. **Better Protrusion Detection**: The improved clustering algorithm provides more reliable counts of real protrusions.

## Downstream Considerations

When using newer versions of this package:

1. Ellipticity values will be inverted from previous versions (1/previous_value)
2. Values previously reported as exactly 1.0 might now be slightly lower (e.g., 0.992)
3. Protrusion counts might differ due to the improved detection algorithm

## Next Steps

1. Monitor the metrics in production usage to confirm the benefits of these changes
2. Consider adding a configuration option to revert to normalized values if needed for backward compatibility
3. Update any downstream visualization tools to account for the new ellipticity scale
