# Progress Report: February 27, 2025

## Summary of Work

Today we implemented the foundation of the `seg-ana` package, a tool for analyzing morphological features of organoid segmentations. The project is designed for a very specific purpose: processing individual mask files (each containing a single mask) and extracting quantitative metrics to be used for downstream analysis.

### Key Accomplishments

1. **Core Implementation**:
   - Created the data loading module with memory-optimized processing
   - Implemented comprehensive morphological metrics calculation using OpenCV
   - Built efficient batch processing functionality

2. **Command-Line Interface**:
   - Developed a streamlined CLI for three key operations:
     - `analyze`: Process masks and export metrics to CSV
     - `info`: Display basic information about masks
     - `generate`: Create synthetic test data

3. **Testing Infrastructure**:
   - Created test modules for core functionality
   - Implemented synthetic test data generation for validation
   - Established a testing framework with pytest

4. **Project Structure**:
   - Set up proper Poetry configuration for dependency management
   - Organized code into logical modules with clear responsibilities
   - Created documentation and examples

### Design Decisions and Refinements

1. **Simplifying the Scope**:
   - Removed visualization capabilities as they were unnecessary for the project's core purpose
   - Focused on "masks in, metrics out" as the primary workflow
   - Streamlined the CLI to only include essential commands

2. **Memory Management**:
   - Designed for processing individual masks, optimized for efficiency
   - Implemented vectorized operations where possible
   - Used OpenCV for optimized contour processing

3. **Performance Focus**:
   - Added caching for structural elements
   - Optimized metric calculations to minimize redundant computations
   - Implemented efficient batch processing

## Next Steps

1. **Validation**:
   - Test the metrics calculation against synthetic shapes with known properties
   - Verify the accuracy of ellipticity, roundness, and other metrics
   - Create a test suite for edge cases (very small objects, irregular shapes)

2. **Additional Metrics**:
   - Consider implementing texture-based metrics if needed
   - Explore additional shape descriptors that might be relevant for organoid analysis
   - Evaluate the need for multi-scale metrics

3. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Profile the code with real datasets to identify bottlenecks
   - Implement additional vectorization where possible
   - Consider parallel processing for very large datasets

4. **Documentation and Examples**:
   - Create Jupyter notebooks with example workflows
   - Document common use cases and best practices
   - Add detailed API documentation with examples

5. **Integration**:
   - Develop tools to integrate metrics with downstream statistical analysis
   - Consider formats for batch processing multiple files
   - Explore options for pipeline integration

## Technical Decisions

1. **OpenCV vs. scikit-image**:
   - Chose OpenCV for contour operations due to better performance
   - Used scikit-image for specific morphological operations where appropriate

2. **Memory vs. Disk I/O**:
   - Prioritized in-memory processing for speed
   - Designed for batches of ~100 images, assuming 8-16GB RAM availability

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Implemented robust error handling for file operations
   - Added validation checks for input data
   - Created informative error messages for troubleshooting

This project provides a solid foundation for organoid morphology analysis with a clear focus on extracting quantitative metrics for downstream analysis.
